# govwatch
Watcher for government apis


## Once apon a time
Governments release data and api services all the time. Open data is a good thing.

Sometimes they release great things, and 6 months later when we have time to build great things apon the data, we find the service is broken. We don't know when it broke or how, but we fluff around finding the person to report it to and then wait months or years for it to be fixed again.. 

Then the cycle begins again.

Introducing GovWatch. The People's Regression Tester.

A suite of unit tests for NZ govt provided data services, that notice breakage early, allowing us to match the breakage to recent changes, and fix early.
